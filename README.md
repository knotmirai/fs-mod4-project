# Module 4 Final Project

# Pneumonia Image Classification with Deep Learning

## The Project

Every day people change from one mobile network to another. Commonly service providers are trying their best to maintain their current customers rather than obtaining a new one. In this project, the classifier will be built to predict the pattern of churn customers to the telecom company.


## The Dataset

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

## Summary

From the analysis, the recommendation for the company are as below:

1. There are only two plans for customers and they are not enough. The company should change to a better plan or add more.

2. The most important factors are the total charge for daytime calls, evening calls, and international. This supports that churn customers are not satisfied with the cost.

3. The current accuracy of the algorithm is 92.81%


## Future Plan

For the future, the more detail about charge should be included because it is the most concern factor for customers. Also, I should try another ME algorithm to ensure the best analysis.
